\section{Introduction}
The origin of the term "67" (pronounced "six seven") is controversial and not clearly known. While memes spread fast among internet communities, their origins become obscured just as quickly as part of this process. Further, research on meme verbiage and internet slang is majorly obstructed by the short-lived nature of these trends, which are often out of date by the time a research paper can even begin to be worked on \parencite{mitali_energy_2022}.
